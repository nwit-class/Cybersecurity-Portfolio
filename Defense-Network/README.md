OVERVIEW

This lab centered on enhancing database security I use Microsoft SQL Server as the center  piece to enhance databse security. 
The tasks principal would include setting up SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), creating a system to log database changes, and configuring alerts to detect unauthorized updates. These types of actions will provide practical experience in securing data through triggers, 
stored procedures, and audit logging. This project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio, highlighting hands-on skills in database protection and monitoring techniques.

Key Takeaway

Creating automatic alerts and audit logs within the database is an effective way to detect unauthorized or unexpected changes. 
These built-in features of SQL Server help maintain data integrity and support compliance efforts.
