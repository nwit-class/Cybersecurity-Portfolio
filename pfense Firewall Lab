#  pfSense Firewall Lab

This project demonstrates the installation and configuration of the **pfSense** firewall in a virtualized environment using **VirtualBox**. It simulates a real-world network by integrating a firewall, WAN and LAN interfaces, and an Ubuntu client. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in network security, traffic control, and secure communication.
